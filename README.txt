This is a final project created for CMPE 332 Introduction to Databases course. It is a combination of a mySQL database, and a COVID Vaccine web application. The web application is intended to display certain information contained in the database, such as vaccination sites and which vaccine doses are available there. A person may record a vaccination they have received and they will be added as a patient to the existing database. 
To run this program, you will need XAMPP to locally host the webpage. Through XAMPP, you must run the SQL script to create the database and add values. Once the phpmyadmin and sqlmyadmin are running, you can go to localhost/covid.php which will direct you to the website mainpage.
