# COVID Website
Final project created for CMPE332 Introduction to Databases course.

This project serves as a combination of an SQL database and a front-end web application. There are pre-exisiting users who have recorded vaccines within the database,
and this information is available to access through the site. One may also record a vaccination of their own, and they will be added to the database. The other feature 
of the web application is that a user may see different healthcare workers that exist in the database, as well as the vaccination site that they work at. In addition to
this, a user may look at the types of vaccines available and they will be shown where those vaccines are available as well as how many doses are available. All patient information
is a placeholder and can be swapped out in the Covid Database file.

To run this project:

1. Start Apache and MySQL through XAMPP
2. In MySQL go to SQL tab and run the SQL script to create the database (if it is the first time running the script, the first line will need to be removed)
3. Go to http://localhost/covid.php
